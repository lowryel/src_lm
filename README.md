### LM ESTATES MANAGER

- LM Estate Manager is a multi-tenant real estate web application where you can list your property for sale or rent.
- We have buyers who are ready to patronize your properties.
- You have equal advantage at selling or renting a property.

----------------------------------
- This website is made with you in mind. You don't have to create an account to buy or rent a property
- However, to sell a property, you need to create an account as a user since you have to list your property.
- You can speak to any agency who will assign you an agent to assist you in finding your next property.

- We are working on getting an agent to sale your property for you. This requires a lot of trust hence why it is        taking time.
- We want to make it secure and trustworthy to deal on this platform
